## About :
Its just a binary shifting program, but it converts the binary into hex codes to make it harder to decode.
You just need to use the **func** class in _**func.cs**_ you can find an example on _**Program.cs**_

### Functions :
- Encode()
- Decode()

### How the program works ?

it simply switches the 1s to 0s and the 0s with 1s:

and then it converts the switched code into a hexadecimal code.

### Uses :
- Secure binary data
- Chatting secretly
- Other ..


**Warning :** This is an old project, so there might be a lot of bugs.
