## About :
its just a binary shifting program, but it converts the binary into hex codes to make it hard to decode .
You just need to use the functions in _**func.cs**_ you can find an example on _**Program.cs**_

### Functions :
- Encode()
- Decode()

### How the program works ?

it takes the 1s and turn them to 0s, same thing with 0s :

and then it converts the switched code into a hexadecimal code.
